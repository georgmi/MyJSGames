@* BUGBUG: Game names and actions should not be hard-coded. 
    Should have a single "PlayGame" action that takes a Game object as an argument, 
    and the Games DB table should contain all the information necessary to load the 
    correct game, as well as the location of the image to display in this table.
    Not in scope for this assignment.*@
