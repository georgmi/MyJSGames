    Hi! We hope you're enjoying our games. You can always play anonymously, but if you were a registered user, 
    you could keep track of the games you've played, see your scores, and compare yourself to other players 
    on our leaderboards. Registration is always free, and we will never give or sell the information you share 
    with us to anybody.
    <br />
    <br />
    The link to sign up (or sign in, if you're already registered) is right up there at the top of the screen.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you'd prefer to continue playing anonymously, feel free to click the "Monster Games" link, also up there
    at the top of the screen.
    <br />
    <br />
    Either way, happy gaming! --The Monster Games staff
